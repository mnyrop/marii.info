Digital Humanities at New York University now has its own flagship site with custom Jekyll theme and a content workflow driven by Google Sheets and GitHub actions.

I had the opportunity to lead the design and devlopment implementation and coordinate sprints with colleagues to build user behavior flows, generate content, and iterate on ux/ui.
