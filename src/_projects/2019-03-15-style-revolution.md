*The digital exhibition presents, online for the first time, all the Journal des dames et des modes plates from the magazine’s most surprising years, 1797-1804, together with their transcribed and translated captions. The digital images were made from an extremely rare, complete set of the engravings, in exceptionally good condition, belonging to the Morgan Library. Work on the vocabulary, text descriptions, locations, patterns, and historical context of the plates was begun by a faculty-student team based at Columbia University, and is ongoing.*
