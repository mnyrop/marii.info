## Project Website:
<https://iiif.io/>

## Project Description:

The IIIF consortium has some brand new, great looking websites!

Over the course of 2021 I got the opportunity to work with IIIF staff to implement a set of Figma designs by Tara Hosseinipour into a configurable Jekyll theme to be used across a series of child sites, including the rich documentation hosted on <https://iiif.io/api>.


You can check out the press release on the [IIIF website](https://iiif.io/news/2021/10/29/new-website-theme/).

And if you have an idea for a new site or redesign (especially if using Jekyll), feel free to get in touch!
