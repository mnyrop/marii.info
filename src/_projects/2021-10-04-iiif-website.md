The IIIF consortium has some brand new, great looking websites!

Over the course of 2021 I got the opportunity to work with IIIF staff to implement a set of Figma designs by Tara Hosseinipour into a configurable Jekyll theme to be used across a series of child sites, including the rich documentation hosted available for the various IIIF APIs.


If you have an idea for a new site or redesign (especially if using Jekyll), feel free to get in touch!
