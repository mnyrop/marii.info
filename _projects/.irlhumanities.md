irlHumanities is a digital and experimental humanities work group started and centered at Amherst College in Amherst Massachusetts. Its members are cross-disciplinary and cross-professional, including academic staff, (under/post)graduate students, and faulty across various fields.

The focus of irlHumanities is on promoting a deeper understanding of immersive reality technologies and narratives as simultaneously textual and algorithmic media. Thus irlHumanities projects take on many forms and lines of argumentation, though they collectively tackle reciprocal questions of how immersive reality (IR) transforms (textual) humanities scholarship, and how humanities scholarship can be brought to bear on the systems and futures of IR.
