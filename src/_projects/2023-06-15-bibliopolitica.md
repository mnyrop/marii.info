*Biblio-Política is a virtual exhibit that documents and shares the story of the Chicano Studies Library at UC Berkeley, one of the first dedicated Chicano Studies libraries in the United States. The project will digitize and make available early library ephemera, photos, and records documenting the library’s unique knowledge organizing system, and create original oral history interviews with some of the library’s early staff. The custom designed exhibit will amplify the little-known stories of innovative library workers while showcasing each digital object with detailed metadata. The exhibit will be built using Wax, an extensible software that can easily be maintained and later stored in a dedicated repository.*

This project is a new collaboration with Amanda Belantara and myself at NYU Libraries; Emily Drabinski, CUNY Graduate Center; Richard Chabrán; Lillian Castillo-Speed, UC Berkeley; and more. It is funded by New York University via a Digital Humanities Seed Grant.
