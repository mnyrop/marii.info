*On the 10th anniversary of the movement, [No Turning Back: Ten Years After Occupy](https://specialcollections.hosting.nyu.edu/exhibitions/occupy/) brings together materials from across the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives to examine that first, critical year of Occupy Wall Street. It includes archival materials that not only capture much of the movement’s tactics, strategies, aesthetics, and language, but also attempt to show how Occupy’s protests became a national phenomenon and were a turning point for left movements globally.*

*The exhibit is organized around the Declaration of the Occupation of New York City, a collectively authored letter to the world, drafted by the Call to Action Working Group and ratified by NYCGA, stating why Occupy protestors were reclaiming public space in the name of the 99%.*
