# Overview

<hr/>
#### <span style="font-weight:400">__1:__ [GitHub](https://github.com) is a place for Open Source projects, which are stored in *repositories*.</span>

#### <span style="font-weight:400">__2:__ A *fork* is a copy of a repository that is all your own and helps you track changes.</span>

#### <span style="font-weight:400">__3:__ [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is an easy to use *markup schema* for designating headings, lists, links, images and more.</span>

#### <span style="font-weight:400">__4:__ [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is software for creating static sites that GitHub can run for you. It is responsible for converting your markdown into your site's HTML files.</span>

#### <span style="font-weight:400">__5:__ [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) is a templating engine that helps you work with your site's data and content in more dynamic ways than Markdown. Jekyll also converts liquid into HTML files for you.</span>

## Step 1: Set up a GitHub Account
***
Visit [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and add your information. Choose the Free/Public plan, then activate your account by checking your email for the registration link.

*__Note:__ Your username will also be part of your site's public URL, so choose one you can live with!*

## Step 2: Fork the sample site into your account
***
Visit the base site repository [https://github.com/mnyrop/nycdh-jekyll](https://github.com/mnyrop/nycdh-jekyll) in a new tab and click on the fork button near the top right corner.

This creates a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) (i.e. a diverging copy) of our base site for you to use and change however you want.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fork.gif" style="width:100%"/>


## Step 3: Set up your GitHub domain
***
Before we start changing how things look, we'll need to see your site live at your own domain.
Click on the Settings tab and rename your repository to reflect your domain. This will be:

> your-username.github.io

For example, if your GitHub username is `bharkonnen`, your site will be `bharkonnen.github.io`.
<br><br>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/rename_repo.gif" style="width:100%"/>

Return back to the page with your files and find `_config.yml`. Click on it, then click the pencil button to edit. Replace the `baseurl` value with empty single quotes: `''`. (This will serve your site at your domain instead of `yourdomain.github.io/nycdh-jekyll/`.)

Next, fill in other information (e.g. `title`, `description`, and `username`) as you like. Scroll down and click "Commit changes" when you are ready.

You can always change these later, so don't worry!
<br><br>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.gif" style="width:100%"/>

## Step 4: View your site
***
Open up a new tab, and navigate to your domain. It may take a minute or so, but should look like something like this:
<br><br>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/view_site.gif" style="width:100%"/>


## Step 5: Edit a post
***
 While still on your live site, click on "Writing My Own Post." (It should be at `yourdomain.github.io/2018/01/22/my-own-post/`.)

 Open the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/mnyrop/nycdh-jekyll/blob/master/docs/markdown-cheatsheet.md) in another tab. And in one more tab, open your site repository on GitHub, navigate into `_posts`, open `2018-01-22-my-own-post.md`, and click edit.

 Skim through the Markdown Cheatsheet and rewrite the contents of the post with headers, lists, and links. Commit the edits and refresh the live post to see your changes.

 *__Note:__ Jekyll is very picky about post titles and dates. If you want to change them, make sure you keep the same date format! Titles cannot have `:` characters unless you wrap the entire title in quotes (`title: "My Tile: My Subtitle"`). Lastly change the file name (up top) to reflect your new title and date.*

 *__Bonus:__ You can use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app) to preview what your Markdown will look like before editing your files, if you like!*


## Step 6: Add a new page
***
Now that we've edited an existing post with Markdown, we can add a brand new page with text and images. Navigate to the home of your site repository on GitHub, and click __"Create New File"__.

Enter the name of your file up top. It **cannot** have spaces or special characters, **must** be lowercase, and must end in **.md** (for Markdown).

__Good:__  
- `my-project-name.md`  
- `test-page.md`  
- `really-long-but-still-okay-name.md `  

__Bad:__
- `has spaces .md`
- `badextension.doc`
- `too-$pec!al.md`

Add metadata to the top of your file, between two lines with three hypthens, like so:
```yaml
---
layout: page
title: Your Title
---
```
Underneath the metadata, add info to your page just like with the post. This time, try to add at least one image! The syntax for an image is:

`![label][http://link-to-full-image.jpg]`

## Advanced: Liquid for Jekyll functionality
***

Congrats! If you're reading this, you're likely ahead of the game. Now is a good time to dive deeper into Jekyll and its templating engine [Liquid](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/introduction-to-liquid/).

Liquid is a kind of pseudo-code that lets you access information about your site, its pages, posts, and more to display on your site.

For example, Liquid is powering your current home page and how it shows posts. Under the hood, it looks something like this:


```liquid
{% raw %}{% for post in site.posts %}

 <h2>
   <a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
 </h2>

 <a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</a>

 <p>{{ post.content | strip_html | truncatewords:30 }}</p>

{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
```

This constructs a post loop so that each of your posts automatically shows up and has the same type of information displayed in the same way.

Try adding your post's categories to one of your posts with liquid. You'll need to replace/add categories in the metadata of your post (in brackets `[ ]` and separated by commas), and then add liquid to the body of your post. To get you started, you'll set up the loop with:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% for category in page.categories %}
 {{ category }}
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
```

## Advanced: Change your theme
***

The following link has a list of themes that are currently supported by GitHub Pages through the `remote_theme` variable in `_config.yml`: [https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme). You can peruse to find one you like and, when you're ready, replace

```yaml
remote_theme:     broccolini/athena
```

with the theme you want, with the structure `username/repository-name`. (e.g. `mmistakes/minimal-mistakes` )
